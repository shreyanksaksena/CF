***A is said to be Multiple of B if B is divisible by A.

First Example :

9 is divisible by 3 , So the answer is: Multiples.

Second Example :

6 is not divisible by 24 but

24 is divisible by 6 , So the answer is: Multiples.

Third Example :

12 is not divisible by 5 and 5 is not divisible by 12.

So the answer is: No Multiples.
